    Optimizes VR performance focusing on GPU utilization.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Frame rendering duration in seconds.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (numerical representation, higher is better).

    Returns:
        float: Optimized performance score between 0 and 1 (higher is better).
               Returns -1 if input validation fails.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if any input is not a number.
