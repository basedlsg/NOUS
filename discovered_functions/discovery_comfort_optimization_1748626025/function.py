    """
    Optimizes VR performance for maximum comfort score.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Frame duration in seconds.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (numerical encoding, e.g., 1,2,3...).


    Returns:
        float: Optimized VR comfort score (0-1, higher is better).  Returns -1 if input is invalid.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if any input is not a number.
        ValueError: if any input is outside the expected range.
