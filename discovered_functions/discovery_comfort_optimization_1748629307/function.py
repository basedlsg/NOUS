    """
    Optimizes VR performance for maximum comfort score.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Duration of VR experience in seconds.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (categorical, needs mapping for numerical processing).

    Returns:
        float: Optimized VR comfort score between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  Returns -1 if input is invalid.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if input is not a number.
        ValueError: if input values are out of range.
