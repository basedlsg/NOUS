    """
    Optimizes VR performance for maximum comfort score.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Duration of VR experience in minutes.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (e.g., 2.0 for RTX 2080, 3.5 for RTX 3090, higher is better).


    Returns:
        float: Optimized VR comfort score between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Returns -1 if input is invalid.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if any input is not a number.
        ValueError: if any input is out of range.
