    """
    Optimizes VR performance for frame time consistency and comfort.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Frame time in seconds.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 representing different tiers).

    Returns:
        float: Optimized performance score between 0 and 1 (higher is better).
               Returns -1 if input validation fails.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if input data types are not numeric.
