    """
    Optimizes VR performance to maximize comfort scores.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage in GB.
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization percentage (0-100).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Frame duration in seconds.
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (numerical representation, e.g., 1 for GTX 1660, 2 for RTX 2070, etc.).

    Returns:
        float: Optimized performance score between 0 and 1 (higher is better).  Returns -1 if input is invalid.
