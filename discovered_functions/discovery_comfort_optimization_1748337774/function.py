    Optimizes VR performance for maximum comfort score.

    Args:
        gpu_util (float): GPU utilization (%).
        vram_usage (float): VRAM usage (GB).
        cpu_util (float): CPU utilization (%).
        scene_complexity (float): Scene complexity score (higher is more complex).
        duration (float): Duration of VR experience (seconds).
        gpu_type (float): GPU type (numerical representation, higher is better).


    Returns:
        float: Optimized performance score between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  Returns -1 if input is invalid.

    Raises:
