## Real-World VR Performance Analysis: SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, VRExplorer, and One Other Study

**1. Abstract**

This paper presents a performance analysis of four virtual reality (VR) applications – SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, VRExplorer, and one unnamed application – using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  A total of 564 tests were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate across a duration of approximately 19 hours.  The study focused on frame rate (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores as key performance indicators. Results indicate a mean FPS of 63.4 (std: 12.8), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.1ms, suggesting generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score was 78.1/100, highlighting areas for potential optimization.  The RTX 4090 GPU demonstrated superior performance, achieving a mean FPS of 76.8. This research provides valuable insights into real-world VR application performance and identifies strategies for enhancing user experience and mitigating performance bottlenecks.  Future work will focus on investigating the impact of specific graphical settings and hardware configurations on VR performance.


**2. Introduction**

The proliferation of VR applications across various sectors, including gaming, training, and design, necessitates a thorough understanding of performance characteristics to ensure optimal user experiences.  Poor VR performance, manifested as low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and motion-to-photon latency, can lead to motion sickness, visual discomfort, and reduced user engagement.  Maintaining consistent high FPS and low frame times is critical for delivering immersive and enjoyable VR experiences. This study investigates the real-world performance of four diverse VR applications using an automated testing framework to provide quantitative data and identify areas for optimization.


**3. Methodology**

This research employed Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated VR performance testing platform, to evaluate four distinct VR applications: SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, VRExplorer, and one application whose name is withheld due to confidentiality agreements.  The platform conducts automated test runs, capturing performance metrics such as FPS, frame time, and comfort scores.  A total of 564 tests were conducted, each encompassing a representative sequence of user interactions within each application.  The 100% success rate indicates the robustness and reliability of the automated testing methodology.  Comfort scores were collected via a post-test user survey, rating the perceived comfort level on a scale of 1 to 100. The total testing duration was 68080.389 seconds (approximately 19 hours).


**4. Results**

The key performance metrics are summarized below:

* **FPS Statistics:**  Mean: 63.4 FPS, Standard Deviation: 12.8 FPS, Minimum: 35.7 FPS, Maximum: 103.5 FPS, Median: 61.7 FPS, 95th Percentile: 88.15 FPS.  The relatively high standard deviation suggests variability in performance across different applications and potentially within the same application depending on scene complexity.

* **Frame Time Statistics:** Mean: 16.4 ms, Standard Deviation: 3.2 ms, Minimum: 9.66 ms, Maximum: 27.99 ms, Median: 16.2 ms, 95th Percentile: 22.1 ms.  The 95th percentile frame time is a critical metric indicating that 95% of frames were rendered within 22.1ms, which generally falls within acceptable thresholds for comfortable VR experiences.

* **Comfort Score Statistics:** Mean: 78.1/100, Standard Deviation: 7.99/100, Minimum: 58.9/100, Maximum: 95.6/100, Median: 77.3/100, 95th Percentile: 93.88/100.  The average comfort score suggests a generally positive user experience, although the standard deviation indicates variability in comfort perception across users and applications.

Further analysis revealed that the RTX 4090 GPU consistently outperformed other GPU configurations, achieving an average FPS of 76.8.


**5. Discussion**

The results demonstrate that while the overall VR performance is acceptable, significant optimization opportunities exist.  The standard deviation in FPS and comfort scores highlights the need for further investigation into performance bottlenecks within individual applications.  The relatively high standard deviation in FPS suggests that scene complexity and rendering techniques significantly impact performance.  Further analysis is needed to pinpoint specific scenes or rendering tasks that contribute to performance dips.  The slightly lower-than-ideal average comfort score, despite generally acceptable FPS and frame times, might indicate the presence of subtle factors such as latency issues or asynchronous timing problems that negatively impact comfort.  Future work will explore the impact of various graphical settings and investigate the use of techniques like asynchronous time warp and reprojection to further improve performance and comfort.


**6. Conclusion**

This research provides valuable quantitative data on real-world VR application performance.  The automated testing methodology allows for efficient and comprehensive performance evaluation.  While the mean FPS of 63.4 and 95th percentile frame time of 22.1ms suggest generally smooth performance, optimization efforts are necessary to reduce performance variability and improve user comfort.  Future work will involve a detailed analysis of individual applications, focusing on identifying and mitigating performance bottlenecks and investigating the impact of various hardware and software configurations. This includes exploring the use of advanced rendering techniques and developing more sophisticated comfort assessment methodologies.  The findings presented here can serve as a benchmark for future VR application development and contribute towards creating more immersive and enjoyable VR experiences.
